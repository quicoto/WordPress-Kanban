# WordPress-Kanban
 WordPress Kanban board app with Vue.js

## TODO

- Do a logged out route when user is logged out (failing call in Boards)
- Do a quick fetch when trying to open the modal for creating a new item, so we know the user is logged in. If it fails, redirect to the "not logged in" route before writing in the modal.
- Add loggin check before editing an item.
